I had made changes to my NLU data and my config.yml file and then I had just trained my nlu model using rasa train nlu command
then I had started my bot using rasa run -m models --enable-api --cors "*" --debug command and then I got the above error : No policy ensemble or domain set. Skipping action prediction and execution
then I figured out that I havenâ€™t trained my rasa core model again just I had trained rasa nlu model
so again I retrained my bot using the rasa train command
and finally the error was resolved :slight_smile:
